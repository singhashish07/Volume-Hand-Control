# Volume-Hand-Control
This project is a volume control system that uses hand gestures to adjust the volume of the computer's audio. It utilizes computer vision techniques to track hand movements and calculates the volume level based on the distance between two specific points on the hand.
## Features
* Real-time hand tracking using the OpenCV library.
* Calculation of volume level based on hand gestures and distance measurements.
* Visualization of the volume level on the screen.
* Adjustable volume range to suit individual preferences.
* Display of frames per second (FPS) for performance monitoring.
## Requirements
* Python 3.11.1
* OpenCv
* Pycaw
